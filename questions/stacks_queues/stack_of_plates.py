# Question:

# Stack of Plates: Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
# Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some
# threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be
# composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity.
# SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks. pop() should behave identically to a single stack
# (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
# FOLLOW UP
# Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub­
# stack.
